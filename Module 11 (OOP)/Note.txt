4 pillar of OOP

- Abstraction: we don't show the complex work that is done behind the scene. hide the information how a data stored in a system.
    ex: How a user login in a website. we don't show the process

- Encapsulation: It encapsulate multiple data. 
    ex: A Object contain name, email and had a function which check how many movie he subscribe. this function will use name and email stored in the object.
    the way it binds these components is called encapsulation. encapsulation ensures Abstraction.

- Inheritance: Inherit one object data to another object, can use data of another object.

- Polymorphism: One object can use another object function in different way



# class: It is a blue print to create a object.
